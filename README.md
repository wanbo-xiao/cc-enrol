For real scenario of council child care enrollment listing 

## background 
  There are a long long waiting list for my council care, and once they have a vacancy, they will go through their list from the top to fit new child in based on following rules <br/>
    - There are n (n=3) rooms by ages,  (0-2)  (2-3) and (3-5)<br/>
    -  Each room vacancy number is fixed , 20 (0-2) 15(2-3) and 15(3-5) maybe.<br/>
    -  Each record in waitling list contains <br/>
      ** Child DOB<br/>
      ** What yearmonth they prefer to join in<br/>
      ** Whick days of week they prefer to join  (MTW / WTF / MTWTF) <br/>
      ** VIP or not<br/>
    - Once a vacancy coming out, they go throught the list , try to find the best way (VIP first, first in first serve, less vacancy better) to fit the child in.<br/>
